      <description>In recent years, electical vehicles have become more and more popular. As a result, the number of charging stations has increased significantly. There is no doubt that this new trend comes with its own challenges. For instance, managing multiple charging stations remotely, monitoring them in real-time, providing a seamless user experience, etc. Of course, those challenges can be addressed by creating backend systems that can communicate with charging stations. Again we have interoperability issues between charging stations and backend systems of different manufacturers.</description>
